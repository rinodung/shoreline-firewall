# Git Repository


Beginning with Shorewall 4.3, the Shorewall project has migrated from Subversion to Git. You may browse the Shorewall Git repository at Sourceforge. There are 5 repositories:

    code -- main repository
    git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/shorewall/code shorewall-code
    
    
    release -- release documents and .spec files
    git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/shorewall/release shorewall-release
    
    tools -- build and web tools
    git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/shorewall/tools shorewall-tools
    
    debian -- Debian release files
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/shorewall/debian shorewall-debian
    
    web -- web site top-level files.
    git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/shorewall/web shorewall-web

You should download and use the latest Git version only at your own risk -- please do not attempt to install Shorewall from the Git components; you will end up with an incomplete and non-working installation.

If you want to build your own packages from the Git images, use the script found in tools/build/build46 (see Build.html).

If you are looking for bug fixes for the current release, see the Download Page.

To create your own copy of one of the repositories, click on the repository icon and copy/paste the displayed clone command.
